# SlpProcess

WIP Rust backend for slippi parsing. Focuses specifically on stats and easy transfer to python.

Limitiations:

* No live parsing
* 1v1 only
* Enum-ing all the values is not done by the backend
* Some fields and replay features that aren't directly relevant to stats are missing
* Error handling is basically non-existant until I settle the API a bit more
