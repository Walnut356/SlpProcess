# SlpProcess

Mostly complete Rust backend for slippi parsing, meant to succeed my python [SlippiStats](https://github.com/Walnut356/SlippiStats) library  Focuses specifically on stats and easy transfer to python.

Limitiations:

* No live parsing
* 1v1 only
* Enum-ing all the values is not done by the backend
* Some fields and replay features that aren't directly relevant to stats are missing
